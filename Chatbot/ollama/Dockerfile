# Use the official Ollama image
FROM ollama/ollama:latest

# The base image already sets up Ollama and exposes port 11434.
# No further configuration needed here for a basic setup.

# Optional: If you want to pull models during build time, uncomment and add RUN commands:
# RUN ollama pull llama3
# RUN ollama pull mistral

# The default entrypoint and command from the base image will start Ollama.
